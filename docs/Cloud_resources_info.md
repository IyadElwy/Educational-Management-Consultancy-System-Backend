# The following summary shows what we will need, in terms of cloud resources

### It's important to note that we will use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and for development purposes we will be taking advantage of the free $300 dollars in credits. For this phase we probably won't even surpass our free credit but we will need a credit card for creating the account.

## Needed Resources:

### - GCP Postgres Database Instance
#### Pricing: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/pricing

### - GCP File Storgae
#### Pricing: https://cloud.google.com/filestore/pricing

### - GCP for Hosting is still unclear. We need to evaluate the finished product to have a clear view of what we'll need but we'll definitely rely on GCP.
